        <pre><blockquote>
            Paste the link to your GitHub page here. That is: username.github.io
            Please also submit the source code here.

            Add a new page to your GitHub website to neatly display some data about our solar system. (Make sure your main page links to the new one, and make sure you an get back to the main page from the planet data.)

            Using the attached Planet Data.pdf, add a table to your new page with proper headings, captions, and structure.
            Your table should group the planets together as they are grouped in the data document, that is Terrestrial Planets, Jovian Planets (Broken into two subgroups Gas and Ice Giants), and Dwarf Planets.

            Run your code through the W3 Debugger discussed in class to make sure you didn't make any formatting mistakes.</blockquote></pre>
